Version 3.0.0 automates downloading using the Google Photos website instead of the Library API. It is a major change. Google [announced](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-photos-picker-api-launch-and-library-api-updates/) in September that the Google Photos Library API would no longer allow "accessing albums and media items not uploaded by your app" after March 31, 2025. A major benefit is the photos downloaded are now the original size. Also, the location data is included if it is shared with you. See [how Google Photos protects your location data](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/11190100).
